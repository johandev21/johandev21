## Projects
### Cloning Notion's Main Page
I'm currently working on a project to clone the main page of Notion using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The goal is to replicate the layout, design, and functionality of Notion's main interface as a way to practice my web development skills.

This project aims to:
- Utilize HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually similar layout.
- Implement interactive elements and transitions present in the Notion interface.
- Improve my understanding of front-end development by working on a real-world-like project.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository related to this project. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated as I continue to refine and enhance this clone project!
